[\0-\377]# valid, (assuming other string has brackets in same positions)
abcde[:* # valid, but none of the characters is considered special
abc xyzdef # should this (str2 longer than str1) evoke a warning?
           # Probably so if we're only translating, but if deleting or
	   # squeezing this might make sense.
abcdef : # should map abcdef all to `:', as if str2 had been [:*]
